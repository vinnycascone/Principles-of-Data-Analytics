    "# Presentation of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Palmer Penguins dataset is a popular dataset used for data analysis and machine learning tasks. It contains measurements and other attributes of penguins collected from three species: Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo, on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica: Dream, Torgersen and Biscoe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the descriptive statistics explained in the data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**count:** This tells you how many data points you have for each measurement. In this case, you have 342 data points for all four measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**mean:** This is the average value for each measurement. For example, the average bill length is approximately 43.92 mm, the average bill depth is approximately 17.15 mm, the average flipper length is approximately 200.92 mm, and the average body mass is approximately 4201.75 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**std:** This is the standard deviation, which measures the amount of variation or dispersion in the data set. It tells you how spread out the values are from the mean. For instance, the standard deviation for bill length is approximately 5.46 mm, for bill depth is approximately 1.97 mm, for flipper length is approximately 14.06 mm, and for body mass is approximately 801.95 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**min:** This is the minimum value observed in the data set. For example, the minimum bill length observed is 32.1 mm, the minimum bill depth observed is 13.1 mm, the minimum flipper length observed is 172 mm, and the minimum body mass observed is 2700 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**25% (Q1):** This is the first quartile, which represents the value below which 25% of the data fall. For example, 25% of the penguins have a bill length of 39.225 mm, a bill depth of 15.6 mm, a flipper length of 190 mm, and a body mass of 3550 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**50% (Q2 or median):** This is the median value, which represents the middle value of the data set when it is ordered from smallest to largest. For example, the median bill length is 44.45 mm, the median bill depth is 17.3 mm, the median flipper length is 197 mm, and the median body mass is 4050 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**75% (Q3):** This is the third quartile, which represents the value below which 75% of the data fall. For example, 75% of the penguins have a bill length of 48.5 mm, a bill depth of 18.7 mm, a flipper length of 213 mm, and a body mass of 4750 g.\n",
    "\n",
    "**max:** This is the maximum value observed in the data set. For example, the maximum bill length observed is 59.6 mm, the maximum bill depth observed is 21.5 mm, the maximum flipper length observed is 231 mm, and the maximum body mass observed is 6300 g.\n",

    "### Modeling the variables\n",
    "\n",
    "To model the variables in the Palmer Penguins dataset in Python, I have considered the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Categorical Variables:  \n",
    "  - Species: This variable represents different penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, or Gentoo). It should be treated as a categorical variable because each species represents a distinct category with no inherent ordering.  \n",
    "  - Island: The island where the penguin was observed (Dream, Torgersen, or Biscoe). Like species, this variable should also be treated as categorical since the islands represent distinct categories without any natural ordering.  \n",
    "  - Sex: The sex of the penguin (male, female, or NA if unknown). This is also a categorical variable since each sex represents a distinct category.\n",
    "- Numeric Variables:   \n",
    "  - Bill Length (bill_length_mm): This represents the length of the penguin's bill in millimeters. It is a numeric variable that can be used for modeling, such as regression analysis.  \n",
    "  - Bill Depth (bill_depth_mm): Similar to bill length, this represents the depth of the penguin's bill in millimeters and can also be treated as a numeric variable.  \n",
    "  - Flipper Length (flipper_length_mm): The length of the penguin's flipper in millimeters. This is another numeric variable suitable for modeling.\n",
    "  - Body Mass (body_mass_g): The body mass of the penguin in grams. This numeric variable provides information about the weight of the penguins and can be useful for modeling purposes.  \n",
    "- Target Variable (Optional):  \n",
    "  - Depending on your analysis goals, you may choose to define a target variable for predictive modeling tasks. For example, if you want to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical characteristics, then species can be considered as the target variable for classification tasks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating categorical variables as categorical types ensures that Python understands them as distinct categories rather than treating them as numeric values with some order or significance.  I'm moving a string variable to a categorical one so that Phyton can analyze it.\n",
    "Numeric variables for modeling allow to perform mathematical operations and statistical analyses on these variables. This enables tasks like correlation analysis, and visualization.  \n",
    "The choice of variables was made on the objective of the analysis. In my example I have done so to understand the relationship between penguin physical characteristics."
